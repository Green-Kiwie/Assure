      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    </span>

    <h4>1. How do I use Assure?</h4>
    <span class="hbox2">It’s simple! Our home screen displays the recommended stocks for the day. From there, choose
      which stocks interest you (perhaps look at our reasons for recommendations), login to your broker and buy the
      stock close to the opening price. Once the stock price has risen to your desired price, you can sell it.

      For those who ask “really?”, you can go to our ‘Past Picks’ section and judge the effectiveness of our algorithm
      yourselves! For those who then say “show me more!”, go right on to our ‘Simulate’ section and try out how
      profitable the stocks are yourselves!</span>

    <h4>2.Does Assure allow me to trade on its platform?</h4>
    <span class="hbox2">No, we do not allow live trading on our platform. However, we have a simple simulation segment
      that allows the user to see how effective our past recommendations are.</span>

    <h4>3. Can I change the tags for the stocks Assure recommends?</h4>
    <span class="hbox2">Absolutely! The tags can be changed to suit the user's choice of stocks to invest. Nevertheless,
      without customisation, the tags would automatically be set to the most popular types of stocks!</span>

    <h4>4. Am I guaranteed to make money in every stock that is recommended?</h4>
    <span class="hbox2">Unfortunately, there is no sure way to make sure that every stock that is recommended will be
      profitable. However, based on backtesting, we strive to beat the odds such that in every stock that we recommend,
      there is a high probability that it would be profitable. In the long run, investors will be sure to grow their
      wealth. </span>

    <h4>5. Can I delete my Assure account?</h4>
    <span class="hbox2">You can unsubscribe from Assure by going into your profile and selecting “unsubscribe”. There
      are no cancellation fees. </span>

    <h4>6. How much money do I need to start investing?</h4>
    <span class="hbox2">With the wide range of stocks Assure recommends, you will easily be able to find a stock that
      fits your budget. Stock prices can range from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars. There really is no minimum
      amount to start investing!</span>

    <h4>7. Can I see the daily stock picks without an Assure account?</h4>
    <span class="hbox2">No, the daily stock picks are only available if you have an Assure account. Nevertheless, you
      can open a 30 day trial account with us to see our daily stock picks within those 30 days!</span>
