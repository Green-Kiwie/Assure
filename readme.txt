Thank you for taking a look at our project. Due to time contraints, the website has not been built as much as planned in the proposal. Nevertheless, some of the functions have been finished:
1. the color theme, icons and fonts for the website with custom assets (the font is not available for the git hub version, see the font design based on the video).
2. a layout of the 4 different pages available on the website, users can move between the pages
3. the algorithm to check for price patterns with the stock market data after it has been parsed into an array. namely: bullish engulfing, piercing line, morning star and upside gap.

Afew more things can be improved on for the website to become fully functional:
1. allow the website to draw stock market price and parse into arrays for algorithm. This is partially completed. currently, stock market data are preloaded into the "Datas" folder.
2. website does not automatically update stock picks yet, this will be linked to the algorithm.
3. simulate function.
